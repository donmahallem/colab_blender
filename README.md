[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/donmahallem/colab_blender/blob/master/runblender.ipynb)


This is a Google Colab Python Notebook which can be used to render blender files with a GPU in the cloud. A google account is required!
With slight modifications it can also be used with other Python Notebook compute offerings like kaggle!


## Instructions

First of all: You will need to own a Google Account!

Once you are logged in you either upload the script found [here](https://github.com/donmahallem/colab_blender/blob/master/runblender.ipynb) to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or just use the `Open in colab` Badge above.

Now you will need to upload your `.blend` file and all needed seperate assets to Google Drive(either via the web gui or desktop application).

Once done open the `runblender.ipynb` in colab and insert your `.blend` files name and path into the specified script fields and run the script.

You will be prompted to authorize that Colab will need access to your Google Drive.

## Other runtimes

This script is not exclusive to Google Colab but might need minor modifications to be able to run!

### Appendix

This script/repository isn't associated with Google Colab or Google in any way!
